                <p>NASA’s James Webb Space telescope now is planning to launch between March and June 2019 from French Guiana,
                    following a schedule assessment of the remaining integration and test activities.
                    Previously Webb was targeted to launch in October 2018.
                    “The change in launch timing is not indicative of hardware or technical performance concerns,”
                    said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington.
                    “Rather, the integration of the various spacecraft elements is taking longer than expected.”

                <p>NASA's Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission is an ongoing robotic space mission involving two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity,
                    exploring the planet Mars. It began in 2003 with the launch of the two rovers: MER-A Spirit and MER-B Opportunity—to explore the Martian surface and geology;
                    both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004. Both rovers far outlived their planned missions of 90 Martian solar days:
                    MER-A Spirit was active until 2010, while MER-B Opportunity is still active in 2018, and holds the record for the longest distance driven by any off-Earth wheeled vehicle.

                <p>Several months before the first human departure, the Mars One selection committee will determine which groups in training are ready to depart to Mars.
                    It is expected that at least six groups will be ready for the trip.
                    Because this mission is humankind's mission,
                    Mars One has the intention to make this a democratic decision.
                    The whole world will have a vote which group of four will be the first humans on Mars.

                    <h3>Mars One Astronaut Training Program</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>After the crews are selected they begin training.
                        The training consists of three (phases) including technical,
                        personal, and group training.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Phase 1: Technical training includes the training of two crewmembers to be proficient in the use and repair of all equipment to the extent that they can identify and solve technical problems.
                        In addition, two crewmembers will receive extensive medical training in order to treat minor, major, and critical health problems.
                        At least one person will train in the studies of Mars geology and the remaining person will gain expertise in exobiology,
                        which is the biology of alien life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Phase 2: Personal training consists of ensuring that the astronauts are able to cope with the difficult living environment on Mars.
                        Since these individuals will be unable to speak to friends and family on Earth face-to-face,
                        a certain amount of coping skills are essential.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Phase 3: Group training will mainly take place through simulation missions.
                        During these simulations, the astronauts take part in a fully immersive exercise that prepares them for the real mission to Mars.
                        The simulated environment will invoke as many of the Mars conditions as possible.
                        Immediately after selection, the groups will participate in these simulations for a few months per year.
